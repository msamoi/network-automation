Ansible playbook to configure HPE Instant On 1830-8 switches and Cisco SG250 switches. NB! Cut back version with placeholders.

Requires the following environment variables to be set:

- NETBOX_TOKEN - Netbox API authentication token
- NETBOX_API - Netbox API url

In the future, the HPE 1830-8 configuration push functionality should be rewritten in Python as a module.
